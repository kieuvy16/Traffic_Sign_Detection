🚦 Traffic Sign Detection Sample Dataset

This directory should contain your traffic sign dataset.
The full dataset is too large for Git, so users should download it separately.

Expected structure:
data/raw/archive/
├── images/          # .jpg files
├── labels/          # .txt files (YOLO format)
├── classes.txt      # Class names
├── classes_en.txt   # English class names
└── classes_vie.txt  # Vietnamese class names

You can download datasets from:
- German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark
- TT100K Dataset
- BelgiumTS Dataset
